# Wireframes

This folder contains the wireframes for the Edusphere College Management System. The wireframes provide visual representations of the user interface design and layout for different sections of the application. You can view the wireframes using the following links:

- [Wireframe 1](https://www.figma.com/proto/CYb9t8wre4uUC25JMHkG9s/College-Mangement?page-id=122%3A2039&type=design&node-id=122-2074&viewport=439%2C320%2C0.31&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=122%3A2074): This wireframe showcases the design and layout for the main dashboard and its components.

- [Wireframe 2](https://www.figma.com/proto/CYb9t8wre4uUC25JMHkG9s/College-Mangement?page-id=97%3A1943&type=design&node-id=97-1954&viewport=430%2C205%2C0.43&scaling=scale-down): This wireframe presents the design and layout for the student attendance management section.

To view the wireframes, simply click on the links above. These wireframes serve as a visual guide for developers, designers, and stakeholders to understand the intended user interface and make informed decisions during the development process.

Please note that the wireframes are subject to change and may not represent the final version of the application's user interface. Any updates or modifications to the wireframes will be communicated and documented accordingly.

## Next Steps

To proceed with the development of the Edusphere College Management System, please consider the following:

1. **Implementation:** Convert the wireframes into actual HTML/CSS templates and integrate them with the application's front-end using the selected technologies.

2. **Functionality:** Develop the necessary backend functionality to support the features and interactions depicted in the wireframes.

3. **Testing and Refinement:** Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it functions as intended and matches the wireframe specifications. Make any necessary refinements based on user feedback and testing results.

4. **Documentation:** Continuously update the project's documentation, including this README file, to provide clear instructions and information about the application's features, installation, and usage.
